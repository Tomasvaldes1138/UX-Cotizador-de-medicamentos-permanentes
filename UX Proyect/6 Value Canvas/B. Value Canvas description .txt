When chronic patients want and need to buy their prescription drugs, they must always go to the pharmacy in person, this is because the pharmacies must check the veracity of the prescriptions, since these establishments do not have the means to sell and dispense these drugs online. This means that people with a wide range of diseases are deprived of the ability to buy their medicines easily, and have to go in person to buy those medicines without being certain that the medicines they need are going to be available for immediate sale. There is also a group of these people who want to save as much money as possible by buying their medicines, so they have to go from pharmacy to pharmacy quoting prices. medicines, which can take too long if done face-to-face, although if done online it can be confusing to have a large number of windows open in the browser. These situations mean that people who need to buy their remedies permanently do not have a simple, quick and easy way to make their quotes and purchases every month.
