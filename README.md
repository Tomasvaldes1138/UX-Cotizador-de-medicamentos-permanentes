# PermaMed - User Experience Design

User experience design process for PermaMed

<p align="justify"> The following project was developed in the context of the "User Experience Design" class, the objective of which is to produce a series of documents that will allow us to identify a suitable design, which can provide comfort and satisfaction to the users when they use our proposal of solution for this project. </p>

## Authors

<p align="justify"> The team is a group of 4 people who are going to work under one of three roles, being this project manager, analyst and designer: </p>

- **Project leader:** Tomás Valdés.

    <p align="justify"> Team role in charge of the organization of the team, being responsible for planning, organizing and leading the different design stages of the project, so that each team member finishes his tasks correctly. </p>

- **Analyst:** Elian Bustamante.

    <p align="justify"> Role of the team that is responsible for identifying the main characteristics of the project, making diagrams such as the value canvas or UX Personas to have devised how to carry out the solution to the problem. </p>

- **Designers:** Daniel Marillanca, Mara Villagrán.

    <p align="justify"> Role of the team in charge of the design and navigation of the website, being responsible for the development of the navigation diagram, wireframes and mockups that meet the needs of the project. </p>

## Problem description

<p align="justify"> When people want and need to buy their medicines for chronic diseases that require prescriptions, they must always do it through the face-to-face method, this is because pharmacies have to check that their prescriptions are not fake, and they do not offer them any option of delivery to the clients' homes. </p>

<p align="justify"> All of this means that people with a wide range of diseases who don’t allow them to go out and buy their medicines easily find themselves having to go out and buy their medicines at certain pharmacies without the assurance that they will have them available for immediate sale, or people who want to save the most money when buying their medicines must be quoted among many pharmacies. Which may also take them too much time to look for which pharmacies have the remedies they are looking for, and it may also be confusing to have a lot of windows open in the search engine. </p>

<p align="justify"> These situations mean that people who need to buy their remedies permanently do not have a simple, quick, and easy way to make their quotes and purchases every month. </p>

## Strategy
	
<p align="justify"> The first step to being taken as a team to proceed with the subsequent solutions and designs is to define the strategy. A "Value Proposition Canvas" is used as a way to compare PermaMed and the possible solution to the client's need. </p>

![A  Value Canvas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65306173/206946669-74d8dc0b-7698-4c2b-b0e3-f5e06e2c79b2.png)
	


<p align="justify"> This process led us to understand our market segment and relate it to a value-added proposition. People with a wide range of illnesses are deprived of the possibility of buying their medicines easily and have to go in person to buy those medicines without having the certainty that the medicines they need will be available for immediate sale. These situations mean that people who need to buy their medicines on a permanent basis do not have a simple, fast and easy way to make their quotations and purchases every month. </p>

## Proposal description

<p align="justify"> So to satisfy the problem of these users, we designed the proposal of PermaMed, which is a website that will allow all people who have a chronic disease and must buy every month the remedies they need to treat their diseases or those who need a remedy prescribed only once, will be able to quote the remedies they want to buy in all those pharmacies that have the remedy available. </p>
 
<p align="justify"> In addition to offering them a graph with the historical price, so they can buy, as it has varied the cost of this over time, also offers customers the possibility of a shopping cart in which they can add all the drugs they need to buy and thus provide them with an easy method of purchase that does not take them too much time doing the same process, for these customers will have to upload their prescriptions to the web to verify that the prescription is valid and to make the purchase process in an agile way. </p>
 
<p align="justify"> Customers will also be able to update their profile information whenever they consider it necessary and will be able to add their different addresses. They will also have the option to review their order history, with the option to view the status of their order and the option to place an order they have already placed in the past. </p>
 
## Solution Scope
	
<p align="justify"> After defining a product strategy, it is important to define a scope. PermaMed's proposal, which consists of a website that will allow all people who have a chronic disease, who must buy every month the remedies they need to treat their diseases or those who need a remedy prescribed only once, to quote the remedies they want to buy in all those pharmacies that have the remedy available. </p>

We create a profile of our ideal customers and visualize how our product will work for them.

<p align="justify"> To satisfy the needs and requirements of the people in the previous section, we must identify the characteristics of similar websites or applications to find out how to make our solution different from the rest. </p>

For this, we compared the functionalities through the benchmark canvas.

## Navigation / Structure
<p align="justify"> The navigation diagram allows us to identify early on (before design) how users will interact with the proposed website. </p>

## Customer Journey Map

<p align="justify"> With the elements described above, now comes the concern of how the user experience of the website will be from the moment they are looking for the website, to the moment when the users have been using it for some time. For this, we have the customer journey map that allows us to identify how user satisfaction will be felt throughout this process. </p>

## Skeleton / Wireframes
	
<p align="justify"> The first step is taken before delivering a well-structured, complete and detailed final design is to draw or establish the basic skeleton of our proposal, through wireframes, where (in low quality) the main functionalities that our website proposal must have been highlighted, to meet the expectations and scope previously stated. </p>

- [The proposed wireframes are shown here](https://github.com/Tomasvaldes1138/UX-Quoter-of-permanent-remedies/blob/9d2b14f114f34853227c4f06c9f7cfa7e3c5eecf/UX%20Proyect/6%20Low%20Fi/Low-fi.png)

## Surface / Mockups
<p align="justify"> Once defined or drawn the basic skeleton of our website proposal through the wireframes previously established, we have a more structured and defined vision on how the mockups or final design for our proposal should be made, these, with much more detail and high quality, as long as it complies with the main functionalities that our proposal must have based on the scope set out above. </p>

The main mockups to highlight:

- **General home:** Main home for unregistered clients.

- **Client home:** Main home for registered clients.

- <p align="justify"> <b>Personal information:</b> All about the personal information of the client, information like Rut, birthdate, names, last name, e-mail and phone number. </p>

- **My prescriptions:** <p align="justify"> Everything related to the client's prescriptions, one of the most important points of our proposal, where you can see the saved prescriptions and their status. </p>

- **Add prescription:** <p align="justify"> In relation to the previous view, the customer can add a new prescription by filling out a form (all fields required) with important information of this prescription along with uploading the file of the same prescription. </p>

- **Prescription status:** <p align="justify"> Continuing with the prescriptions, this view allows you to see the status of the prescription added by the customer, where you can see if it was received, or is under review or finally approved. </p>

- **List products:** A list of specific products according to the search made by the client, along with the possibility of filtering these products, another important point based on the problem. </p>

- **Medication:** <p align="justify"> Everything related to the product or medication information, such as viewing the basic information about it (price, name, code, brand), viewing the historical price, viewing a price comparator of the same product in different pharmacies, as well as products related to it. This view corresponds to another of the most important points of our proposal to highlight based on the problem. </p>

<p align="justify"> Previously, we mentioned the main mockups to highlight which constitute the main solutions to the problems encountered, these mockups correspond mainly to our proposal. However, other mockups must also necessarily be part of this proposal, such as allowing the online purchase of a product or medicine, payment methods, order tracking, purchase history, shopping cart, allowing to register a new customer, allowing to edit the customer's personal information, allowing to add addresses, among other mockups which are justified in order to provide the best user experience based on the problems encountered. </p>

- [The proposed mockups are shown here](https://github.com/Tomasvaldes1138/UX-Quoter-of-permanent-remedies/blob/9d2b14f114f34853227c4f06c9f7cfa7e3c5eecf/UX%20Proyect/7%20Mockups/Mockups.png)

## Modifications

<p align="justify"> For this second and last advance of our project, it is worth mentioning that modifications were made such as changing where our website proposal is oriented, where we must differentiate from traditional e-commerce, this emphasizing the quotation and implement more seriousness in what is related to medical prescriptions since these points are the most important in regard to the problem that we seek to solve. Modifications were made regarding the design of the mockups, such as spacing, font size and thickness, among other minor details. </p>
